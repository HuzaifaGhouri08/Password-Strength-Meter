# Password-Strength-Meter

I used Streamlit to create a clean and intuitive login page with input fields for username and password.

Custom CSS styling ensures a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.

The core of this project is a password strength checker. It evaluates passwords based on length, inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Users receive instant feedback on their password's strength (Weak, Moderate, Strong).

Real-Time Feedback:
If a password doesn't meet the security criteria, the application provides clear warnings and suggestions for improvement.

An expander feature allows the user to see exactly what criteria their password is missing.
Login Success/Failure:

If the password meets all the criteria, the user is given a success message, if not an error message is displayed.
